The code is from https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP.

- [input](https://github.com/VanessaYan/STAT-453-Malaria-Bounding-Boxes-Detection/tree/master/code/Fast%20RCNN/mAP-master/input) This folder has been changed using our own data.
  The detection-results folder contains 120 predicted boxes with labels from 120 test images. The names of the lines are:
  <predicted_label> <score> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
  The ground-truth folder contains 120 true boxes with labels from 120 test images. The names of the lines are:
  <true_label> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>

- We run the [Result.ipynb](https://github.com/VanessaYan/STAT-453-Malaria-Bounding-Boxes-Detection/blob/master/code/Fast%20RCNN/mAP-master/Result.ipynb) to get the mAP of prediction on the test dataset with our own trained model.

- [output](https://github.com/VanessaYan/STAT-453-Malaria-Bounding-Boxes-Detection/tree/master/code/Fast%20RCNN/mAP-master/output): This folder shows the results of mAP.
