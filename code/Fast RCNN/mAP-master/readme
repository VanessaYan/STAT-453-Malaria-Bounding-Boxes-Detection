The code is from https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP.

The input folder has been changed with our own data.
The detection-results folder contains 120 predicted boxes with labels from 120 test images. The names of the lines are:
<predicted_label> <score> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
The ground-truth folder contains 120 true boxes with labels from 120 test images. The names of the lines are:
<true_label> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>

We run the Result.ipynb to get the mAP of prediction on the test dataset with our own trained model.
